## 09.03-09.27, 09.30-09.46: Figure 3

This used data I had already produced, and I could easily reuse my function from Figure 2 - just had to input the right parameters. Add letters to subplot to improve clarity.

Feel to be successfully reproduced at 09.46

```{python}
import sys
sys.path.append('../')
from timings import calculate_times

# Minutes used prior to today
used_to_date = 607

# Times from today
times = [
    ('09.03', '09.27'),
    ('09.30', '09.46')]

calculate_times(used_to_date, times)
```

## Timings

```{python}
import sys
sys.path.append('../')
from timings import calculate_times

# Minutes used prior to today
used_to_date = 607

# Times from today
times = [
    ('09.03', '09.27'),
    ('09.30', '09.46')]

calculate_times(used_to_date, times)
```
