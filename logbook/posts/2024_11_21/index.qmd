Redid badge evaluation.

:::

## 10.34-10.36: Revisit evaluation

Revisited and revised the badge criteria to (a) make them up-to-date, and (b) make sure they are *specific* to the descriptions from each badge. Hence, redoing evaluations for all eight studies.

Notes:

* Reproduction - no, as added reasonable assumption that would expect this within a reasonable time (e.g. a few hours) and with only minor troubleshooting - but this reproduction required a large time investment and extensive troubleshooting (e.g. writing code) to reproduce

## Untimed: Update summary report

With new badge evaluation results.
