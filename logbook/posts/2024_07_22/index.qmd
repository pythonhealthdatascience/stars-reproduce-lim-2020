## 09.18-10.08, 10.18-11.38: Converting supplementary tables to CSV

Copied each table into LibreOffice Calc and saved as CSV.

As all tables had the same structure, I wrote a script that reformats them. This is so that they don't "share" cells, and instead each row has all the information needed to identify it, making them easier to use and compare against later on.

Displayed these within the scope page.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Reflection

This took a longer than expected to reformat and sort, and so provision of tables in a "usable" format would have facilitated reproduction, although I understand that the tables that were provided are far more readable and easy to look at.

## 11.40-11.42: Updating README

Modifying from template.

## 11.48-11.55: Checking scope

Had another look over the paper to double check if I could spot anything that I think could be in scope.

Appears likely that the supplementary tables might actually often contain the data used to produce the figures, which is handy, as if I weren't able to reproduce the results themselves, I would still be able to use that data to produce the figures (potentially (?) unless we would want to do it from scratch).

Did spot another result - "*The strongest protective effect is seen with the N95 masks (nearly equivalent to a FFP2 mask), which has the effect of reducing the odds of transmission by 0.09.*" - which, on reflection, might be an additional item for the scope, as the odds of transmission are not calculated/provided within the tables or figures.

All other text though seems to be interpreting the figures and tables presented, and not providing new results.

## 15.23-X: Consensus on scope and archive repository

Messaged with Tom who had a look over the scope and agreed he was happy with it. Also, happy with not emailing authors again re: starting reproduction.

Update CHANGELOG.md and CITATION.cff before then creating a release to archive the repository on Zenodo.

## Timings

```{python}
import sys
sys.path.append('../')
from timings import calculate_times

# Minutes used prior to today
used_to_date = 82

# Times from today
times = [
    ('9.18', '10.08'),
    ('10.18', '11.38'),
    ('11.40', '11.42'),
    ('11.48', '11.55')]
# TODO: Add remaining times

calculate_times(used_to_date, times)
```
