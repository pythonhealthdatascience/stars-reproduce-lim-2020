Created reproduction.ipynb to run model and then produce outputs, and add ipykernel to environment (required for .ipynb).\nThen ran the model. Whilst it ran, it printed lots of SettingWithCopyWarning errors for stafflist['infected'][staff_infected[i]]=1 and stafflist['infected'][roster.iloc[0][0]]=1. (SettingWithCopyWarning: A value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame.) I anticipate these could be resolved with the following changes (which I’ll implement once it’s finished running):\n\nstafflist.loc[staff_infected[i], 'infected'] = 1\nstafflist.loc[roster.iloc[0][0], 'infected'] = 1\n\nWasn’t certain how long model should take, but paused record of time whilst it ran. After 10 minutes though, I decided to cancel that, and instead just run one version of the input parameters for the model (i.e. one choice from staff per shift, shifts per day, strength, staff change).\nI copied over the functions into the .ipynb and ran one version of model. Can see this outputs a table where columns are the strength and staff change. I tried running a few to understand how the results table was being produced. I then add code to save the results to .csv.\nPresently, I think this might only be for one shift per day, although I might be wrong.\nOnce home, set model to run the full loop from the .py script. This took 19 minutes 8 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflection\n\n\n\nModel run time does have an impact on how easy it is to rerun (or then reuse) a model."

    "text": "09.40-11.12, 11.17-11.27: Adding parallel processing\nHaving now run the full model code that was provided, I can see that the loop produced a 10x4 table (for each of the end by day 7, 14 and 21). It varies:\n\nStaff strength (4, 6)\nFrequency of staff change (1, 3, 7, 14, 21)\nNumber of staff per shift (5, 10, 20, 30)\n\nIt doesn’t include:\n\nStaff strength 2 - should be easy to add to loop\nScenarios from paper (e.g. varying probability of secondary infection) - although that example is easy to change with p = 0.15 # secondary attack rate\n\nIt had quite a long run time (19m 8s) which will make it difficult to run all these variants. Hence, I will first try to introduce parallel processing to help speed up the reproduction.\n\nFirst, I modified model.py so the model is run by a function, that is then more easily callable from the reproduction notebook. Initially this was a single function, but then I realised I needed to divide it into a function that runs the model with a single set of parameters, and a function that loops through scenarios, to be easily compatable with parallel processing\nTo simplify/improve reusability of varying the number of staff per shift, I changed the results dataframe index from 0-4 to be based on the provided variants for staff per shift (e.g. 5, 10, 20, 30)\nWhilst running these, noted we do so fluctuation between re-runs (e.g. 0.47 to 0.54 for day 21 4-1)\nThen I introduced from multiprocessing import Pool and modified the nested for loop so that we can instead apply the function in parallel. I also had to modify how the results dataframes as created, as they were all modifying the same objects, which wouldn’t be possible in parallel.\n\nThis now ran in 2m 40s - 3m 6s. This is great, and will make running all the different scenarios much easier. By eye, the variation in results before and after parallel processing is very minimal, and all within the range I would expect due to there being no seed control.\nHid warnings and print progress message to enable cleaner output."

Lim et al. (2020)\nI wasn’t certain how to alter the shifts per day from the model, but I tried commenting out shift 2 and 3 in contact(). to see if the model would run. However, I still got the error from above. I introduced error handling, to set the result to NaN if there was a Value Error. With those sections still commented, and only running strength 2, the only results it output were for 2-21.\nI tried uncommenting shifts 2 and 3 and running for strength 2. However, this again only output results for 2-21."
