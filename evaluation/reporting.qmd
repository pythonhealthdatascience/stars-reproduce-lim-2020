| **Objectives** | 
| 1.1 Purpose of the model | Explain the background and objectives for the model | ‚úÖ Fully | Provided in `1. Introduction` -"The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) has recently formed a Taskforce on COVID-19 to provide guidance to laboratory practitioners in managing this challenge [COVID-19]... A global survey by the Taskforce has then revealed that clinical laboratories have used PPE variably. The laboratories also found it challenging to manage staff rostering, split team arrangement and maintain workplace social distancing (physical distancing)... this simulation study was conducted to explore the relative impact of staff rostering, split team arrangement, social distancing and use of PPE on the potential risk of transmission within the laboratory environment. From the results of this simulation, several recommendations are de- veloped to further assist laboratories in planning their workplace in order to minimize the risk of transmission of SARS-Cov-2 infection."<br><br>@lim_staff_2020 |
| 1.2 Model outputs | Define all quantitative performance measures that are reported, using equations where necessary.  Specify how and when they are calculated during the model run along with how any measures of error such as confidence intervals are calculated. | ‚úÖ Fully | All outputs are medians. `2.2 Transmission assumptions` - "the median of the proportion of staff infected are recorded"<br><br>@lim_staff_2020 |
| 1.3 Experimentation aims | If the model has been used for experimentation, state the objectives that it was used to investigate.<br>(A) Scenario based analysis ‚Äì Provide a name and description for each scenario, providing a rationale for the choice of scenarios and ensure that item 2.3 (below) is completed.<br>(B) Design of experiments ‚Äì Provide details of the overall design of the experiments with reference to performance measures and their parameters (provide further details in data below).<br>(C) Simulation Optimisation ‚Äì (if appropriate) Provide full details of what is to be optimised, the parameters that were included and the algorithm(s) that was be used.  Where possible provide a citation of the algorithm(s). | ‚úÖ Fully  | The various parameters and scenarios of the analysis are described in detail in `2. Material and methods` in sections:<br>‚Ä¢ `2.1.1 Number of staff per shift and number of shifts`<br>‚Ä¢ `2.1.2 Overall number of staff accessible to work in the laboratory (i.e. overall staff pool)`<br>‚Ä¢ `2.1.3 Shift arrangement`<br>‚Ä¢ `2.1.4 Split team arrangement`<br>‚Ä¢ `2.3 Secondary attack rate`<br>‚Ä¢ `2.4 Impact of personal protective equipment`<br>‚Ä¢ `2.5 Impact of social distancing`  |
| **Logic** |
| 2.1 Base model overview diagram | Describe the base model using appropriate diagrams and description.  This could include one or more process flow, activity cycle or equivalent diagrams sufficient to describe the model to readers.  Avoid complicated diagrams in the main text.  The goal is to describe the breadth and depth of the model with respect to the system being studied. | ‚úÖ Fully | `Figure 1`<br><br>![Figure 1](../original_study/fig1.jpg){.lightbox}<br><br>@lim_staff_2020 |
| 2.2 Base model logic | Give details of the base model logic. Give additional model logic details sufficient to communicate to the reader how the model works. | ‚úÖ Fully | Detailed in `2. Material and methods` and supported by `Figure 1`. |
| 2.3 Scenario logic | Give details of the logical difference between the base case model and scenarios (if any).  This could be incorporated as text or where differences are substantial could be incorporated in the same manner as 2.2. | ‚úÖ Fully | Detailed in `2. Material and methods` |
| 2.4 Algorithms | Provide further detail on any algorithms in the model that (for example) mimic complex or manual processes in the real world (i.e.  scheduling of arrivals/ appointments/ operations/ maintenance, operation of a conveyor system, machine breakdowns, etc.). Sufficient detail should be included (or referred to in other published work) for the algorithms to be reproducible.  Pseudo-code may be used to describe an algorithm. | ‚úÖ Fully | The only sampling algorithm used in the model is the Poisson distribution for sampling the number of successful contact per infected staff, and this is described in `2.2 Transmission assumptions`<br><br>"Due to the stochastic nature of virus transmission, not all contacts lead to successful virus transmissions. Therefore, the probabilistic factor of p is applied to the average contact rate parameter c in a modified Poisson distribution for the number of ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù contacts, which refers to contacts that lead to successful viral transmission, per work shift. Mathematically, it is described by: P(k) = (pc)k/k! e-pc where P(k) represents the probability for k successful contact in a work shift, with k being a non-negative integer, p is the probability of transmission while c is the average contact rate (i.e. average number of unique contacts in a shift). From this Poisson distribution k is drawn randomly when susceptible staff are assigned to a shift with at least one infected staff. Subsequently, k staff are randomly drawn from other staff in the same shift to be infected to propagate the infection. Of note, P is a function of R0 (the basic reproduction number), contact rate and length of infection period for an entire population"<br><br>@lim_staff_2020 |

The state of working in the laboratory is further divided into sub-states, representing each work shift, for rosters with more than 1 shift per day."<br><br>@lim_staff_2020 |
| 2.5.3 Components - resources | List all the resources included within the model and which activities make use of them. | N/A | The entity (lab staff) does not require any resources to complete the activity (going on shift). Instead, the model just requires a certain number of entities to be doing the activity. |
| 2.5.4 Components - queues | Give details of the assumed queuing discipline used in the model (e.g. First in First Out, Last in First Out, prioritisation, etc.). Where one or more queues have a different discipline from the rest, provide a list of queues, indicating the queuing discipline used for each.

DES studies included different types of decision problems, eg, those listed in previously developed taxonomies. | ‚úÖ Fully | Minimising transmission of COVID-19 in laboratories, as in `1 Introduction`. |
| 2 Is the modeled healthcare setting/health condition clarified? | ...the physical context/scope (eg, a certain healthcare unit or a broader system) or disease spectrum simulated was described. | ‚úÖ Fully | The context here is the laboratories and their strategies to minimise transmission. It describes the current situation, with regards to that. Other description of the laboratories is not felt to be necessary.<br><br>`1 Introduction` - "The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) has recently formed a Taskforce on COVID-19 to provide guidance to aboratory practitioners in managing this challenge. The Task Force has already published biosafety recommendations, which outlined the steps that laboratories operating at biosafety level 1 and level 2 shall or may use to lower the risk of workplace transmission of the virus. These in- cluded the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), temperature and symptom monitoring, split team work arrangements and workplace social distancing. A global survey by the Taskforce has then revealed that clinical laboratories have used PPE variably. The laboratories also found it challenging to manage staff rostering, split team arrangement and maintain workplace social distancing (physical distancing)" @lim_staff_2020 |

It was assumed that this type of validation should be conducted by external evaluators with no stake in the study. | ‚ùå Not met | - |
| 12 Is cross validation performed and reported | ...comparison across similar modeling studies which deal with the same decision problem was undertaken. | ‚ùå Not met | - |
| 13 Is external validation performed and reported? | ...the modeler(s) examined how well the model‚Äôs results match the empirical data of an actual event modeled. | N/A | Since this article was submit relatively early in the COVID-19 pandemic, it is reasonably assumed that there may not yet have been empirical data available to compare against, although we note that the paper does not mention whether or not this is the case. |
| 14 Is predictive validation performed or attempted? | ...the modeler(s) examined the consistency of a model‚Äôs predictions of a future event and the actual outcomes in the future. If this was not undertaken, it was assessed whether the reasons were discussed. | N/A | This is only relevant to forecasting models. |
