Of the 9 items in the scope, 100% (9 out of 9) were considered to be **successfully reproduced**.

As cited throughout, images on this page are sourced from @lim_staff_2020

Due to the size of the original tables, I have previewed the head of each, but then presented descriptive statistics from comparing all the values in each table.

## Time-to-completion

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from time_to_complete import process_times, success_static, success_interactive

# List of time to complete each item
time_list = [
    [607, 'Figure 2'],
    [647, 'Figure 3'],
    [655, 'Figure 4'],
    [747, 'Figure 5'],
    [486, 'Supplemental table 2'],
    [513, 'Supplemental table 3'],
    [513, 'Supplemental table 4'],
    [714, 'Supplemental table 5'],
    [690, 'Supplemental table 6']]
times_df = process_times(time_list)
```

Non-interactive plot:

```{python}
success_static(times_df)
```

Interactive plot:

```{python}
success_interactive(times_df)
```

## Supplemental Table 2

**Consensus: Successfully reproduced**

Preview of the reformatted original table (@lim_staff_2020) alongside the reproduced table.

Then, shares the results from calculating the absolute difference in the `prop_infected` row between the tables, and describes the observed differences.

```{python}
from compare_tables import view_tables

view_tables('../original_study/supp_tab2_reformat.csv',
            '../reproduction/outputs/supp_tab2_reformat.csv')
```

## Supplemental Table 3
