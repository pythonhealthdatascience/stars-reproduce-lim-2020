## Figure 2

![Figure 2. "Panels a, b and c show impact of different roster arrangements (number of shifts, number of staff per shift, total staff pool) on the proportion of staff infected by workplace transmission. The secondary attack rate is set at 15% with the stimulated staff working non-consecutive days. Panel d shows the effect of different secondary attack rates on proportion of staff infected." @lim_staff_2020](../original_study/fig2.jpg){width=80% .lightbox}

## Supplemental Table 2 

Supplemental Table 2. "Proportion of simulated laboratory staff infected by COVID-19 in base scenario with 15% probability of secondary infection at the end of day 7, day 14 and day 21 of the simulation. In this base scenario, the simulated staff worked fixed alternating workdays (i.e. fixed consecutive days on, and fixed minimum consecutive days off). The results shown are the median of 100 cycles of simulation. NA = not available as the number of staff per shift is too low to simulate under the required conditions." @lim_staff_2020

In this scenario, the simulated staff worked fixed alternating workdays (i.e. fixed consecutive days on, and fixed minimum consecutive days off).

"Proportion of simulated laboratory staff infected by COVID-19 in base scenario with 15% probability of secondary infection at the end of day 14 of the simulation with the staff observing workplace social distancing (by reducing the contact rate by half) and using various personal protective equipment. In this scenario, the simulated staff worked fixed alternating workdays (i.e. fixed consecutive days on, and fixed minimum consecutive days off). The results shown are the median of 100 cycles of simulation. NA = not available as the number of staff per shift is too low to simulate under the required conditions." @lim_staff_2020
